This means that you have paid into the state\u2019s disability insurance fund. You can apply for payment on [California Employment Development Department\u2019s website](https://edd.ca.gov/disability/paid-family-leave/ "Paid Family Leave") for Paid Family Leave.\n\nFor California workers who do not receive a W-2, consider visiting these other resources:\n\n*  California Employment Development Department\u2019s website on Paid Family Leave for Pregnant Mothers \n\n* California Employment Development Department\u2019s website on Paid Family Leave for Self Employed individuals\n\n* Legal Aid at Work\u2019s website to find more resources or to call their hotline.\n\nFor non-California workers, you may be able to learn more about your benefits by:\n\n* Searching online for your state and \u201cPaid Family Leave\u201d to see if your state has a similar program\n\n* Finding out if your employer offers Short Term Disability insurance. If so, read the benefits plan carefully. If it covers pregnancy, you may be able to submit a claim to the insurance plan and receive partial payment for your time off.\n\n* Finding out if your employer offers maternity, paternity, or parental leave. You could find out either by reading an employee handbook if your employer has one, or asking your Human Resources department.\n',d={not_supported:{label:"Sorry",md:u},not_ca:{label:"Sorry",md:u},not_w2:{label:"Sorry",md:u},low_earner:{label:"Sorry",description:"Please check with your employer.
