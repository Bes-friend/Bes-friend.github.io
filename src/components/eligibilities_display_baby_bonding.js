        You likely are eligible for 8 weeks of partial pay while taking time
        off, using the
        &nbsp;<a href='https://edd.ca.gov/disability/paid-family-leave/'>
          California State Paid Family Leave
        </a> program.
        Check with your employer and California State Family Leave

        If you work for an employer with at least 5 employees (including
        yourself), and you have worked at least 1 year for this employer,
        your employer MUST allow you to take up to 12 weeks off during
        this first year with your new child. Your employer is required
        to allow you to come back to the same or comparable job when
        you return from leave. You do not need to take all 12 weeks off.
