            Talk to your employer to understand what options you have to get paid during your time off. You should also check your paystub for a deduction called 'CA SDI.' If it appears on your current paystub, or on any paystub from the last 18 months, you may be eligible to claim payments from the <a href='https://edd.ca.gov/disability/paid-family-leave/'>California Paid Family Leave program</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          Your right to take this time off is granted by the <a href='https://www.dfeh.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2020/12/Coming-Soon_Expanded-Family-And-Medical-Leave_ENG.pdf'>California Family Rights Act</a> and by the <a href='https://www.dfeh.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2020/12/Pregnancy-Disability-Leave-Fact-Sheet_ENG.pdf'>Pregnancy Disability Leave law</a>. Your employer is allowed to offer you a longer period of time off, or to pay you more than what the state provides while you are out. However, your employer cannot offer you less or prevent you from taking the time off.
